> Generate your resume (HTML, PDF) from your Linked information with Gatsby 💪

Target audience is mainly developers who are tired of updating their CV's every now and then.

**Live Demo ✨**
- [Web version][url]
- [PDF version][url-pdf]

## Why is this project archived?

I started this project to fix the problem to always keep aligned your LinkedIn and CV in one place, and I was quite happy with the result. But in the last release of [Standard Resume](https://standardresume.co/), they made quite a lot of features that it will take me more time to mantain and keep up with this.

With that being said, I decided to not maintain this project anymore by archiving it. You can still use the `theme` and take care of all the dependencies bump conflicts. Thanks for understanding!

## What does it include? 📦

- Static hosting of your resume in `html` and `pdf` version powered with [Gatsby][gatbsy].
- [JSON Resume][json-resume] template integration.
- Automatic process of crawling your LinkedIn information with [scrapedin][scrapedin].
- Mapping from the crawler data to the [JSON Resume Schema][json-resume-schema]
- Typescript codebase with [runtime validators][typescript-json-validator].
- CLI interaction using [Commander][commander] and [Inquirer][inquirer]

## Setup ⚙️

```bash
> git clone  https://github.com/EmaSuriano/gatsby-starter-linkedin-resume.git
> yarn --ignore-engines
> yarn start

info gatsby serve running at: http://localhost:9000/
```

## Scripts 🏃‍♂️

- `start`: build the project and serve it locally in the [https://localhost:9000](https://localhost:9000).
- `build`: generate public folder to be deployed using [Netlify](http://netflify.com/).
- `generate-resume`: Crawl your data and regenerate your resume.

## How does it work? 🤔

![How it works](./docs/how-it-works.svg)

Given that accessing the values from LinkedIn is quite restricted, I decided to use an open-source scrapper that will go to your [**Public Profile**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/me), crawl all your information and save it inside the repository.

This project is not saving any of your credentials, they are only being used by the crawler to login inside LinkedIn.

Then the LinkedIn information is going to be map into the [JSONResume Schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/), which is going to be read to generate your Resume.
